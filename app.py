    gr.Markdown("ChequeEasy is a project that aims to simplify the process of approval of cheques and making it easier for both bank officials and customers. \
    This project leverages Donut model proposed in the paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15664/\"> OCR-free Document Understanding Transformer </a> for the parsing of the required data from cheques. \
    Donut is based on a very simple transformer encoder and decoder architecture. It's main USP is that it is an OCR-free approach to Visual Document Understanding (VDU) and can perform tasks like document classification, information extraction as well as VQA. \
    OCR based techniques come with several limitations such as requiring use of additional downstream models, lack of understanding about document structure, requiring use of hand crafted rules for information extraction,etc. \
    Donut helps you get rid of all of these OCR specific limitations. The model for the project has been trained using a subset of this  <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/medali1992/cheque-images/\"> kaggle dataset </a>. The original dataset contains images of cheques of 10 different banks. \
    A filtered version of this dataset containing images of cheques from 4 banks that are more commonly found in the Indian Banking Sector was created with ground truth prepared in the format required for fine-tuning Donut. This <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/shivi/cheques_sample_data/\"> dataset </a> is available on the Hugging Face Hub for download.")

            - This model can be further trained to parse additional details like MICR Code, Cheque Number, Account Number, etc.   \
            - Additionally, the app compares if the extracted legal & courtesy amount are matching which is an important check done during approval process of cheques. \
            - It also checks if the cheque is stale. A cheque is considered stale if it is presented to the bank 3 months after the date mentioned on the cheque.")
